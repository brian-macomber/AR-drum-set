# Augmented Reality Drum Set - EC500 Final Project

By Brian Macomber and Nadim El Helou

## Summary

This project is an android application that projects a drum set onto a given image target.
The user can interact with certain parts of the drum set and hear sound when the drum or cymbal is hit.

## User Stories

As a drummer, I would like to be able to play anywhere since drums are not portable.
As an AR user, I would like to play the drums without latency.

## How to run

- Open the app on an android device
